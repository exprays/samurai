# Plugin System Design Document

## Overview

The MCP Super Server plugin system provides a flexible, secure, and extensible architecture for integrating various external services and capabilities. Each plugin represents a specific MCP server instance with its own configuration, lifecycle, and capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Plugin Interface
All plugins must implement the `Plugin` interface which defines the standard lifecycle and communication methods.

### Plugin Types
- **MCP Plugins**: Implement MCP protocol for LLM integration
- **Service Plugins**: Direct service integrations (SMS, Email, etc.)
- **Utility Plugins**: Helper functions and tools

### Plugin Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**: Plugin discovery and registration
2. **Loading**: Plugin initialization and dependency resolution
3. **Configuration**: Plugin-specific configuration loading
4. **Starting**: Plugin activation and service binding
5. **Running**: Normal operation state
6. **Stopping**: Graceful shutdown
7. **Unloading**: Resource cleanup and removal

## Architecture

### Plugin Manager
Central component responsible for plugin lifecycle management, registry, and communication coordination.

### Plugin Registry
Maintains plugin metadata, status, and capability information.

### Plugin Loader
Handles plugin discovery, loading, and dependency management.

### Plugin Sandbox
Provides isolation and security boundaries for plugin execution.

## Security Model

### Isolation
- Each plugin runs in its own context
- Resource limits and quotas
- Permission-based access control

### Communication
- Structured message passing
- Validated input/output
- Audit logging for all plugin operations

## Configuration Schema

Each plugin includes:
- Metadata (name, version, description)
- Dependencies and requirements
- Configuration schema
- Capability declarations
- Resource requirements

## Integration Points

### MCP Protocol
Plugins can expose MCP capabilities:
- Tools and functions
- Resources and data sources
- Prompts and templates

### API Endpoints
Plugins can register custom HTTP endpoints for direct access.

### Event System
Plugins can subscribe to and emit system events.
